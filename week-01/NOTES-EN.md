# ðŸ§  Important Notes

## How to extract the metric
  - time vs space
    - Formula: T = an + b (t = time, a = constant, n = problem size, b = constant)

## Constant Time: O(1)

The algorithm will always run at the same time. Regardless of the amount of data you receive,
The algorithm will always run at the same time. Regardless of the amount of data you receive.

`Example: access to an array`

## Linear Time: O(n)

When the time of the algorithm is dependent on the value of n (input data).

`Example: Linear Search`

## Logarithmic Time: O(log n)

When the algorithm reduces the size of the input data with each iteration. That is, the algorithm divides the size of the input data at each iteration.

`Example: Binary Search`

## Quadratic Time: O(nÂ²)

When each value in the input data needs the algorithm to do a linear operation on it.

`Example: bubble sort`

## Exponential Time: O(2^n)

When the algorithm solves the problem of size n (data input) recursively with two sub-problems of size n-1.

`Example: fibonacci`

## Factorial Time: O(n!)

When the algorithm time grows factorially according to the input data.

`Example: Permutation`

## Final Words

- O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(nÂ²) < O(2^n) < O(n!)
